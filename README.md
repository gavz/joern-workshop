# Joern Workshop

This workshop consists of 3 modules covering various concepts around Interactive Code Analysis using [Joern](http://joern.io). We use VLC v3.0.7 as the primary target application along with a few memory allocation examples present in this repo. The workshop consists of 3 modules:

1. **Module 1 (Code Surfinâ€™)** : Basic navigation and obtaining insights about code using Joern
2. **Module 2 (Memory Memoire)** : Explore and learn about possible memory allocation related bugs
3. **Module 3 (Scripting Away to Glory)**: Create reusable scripts from your analysis and build your own tools using Joern.

## Workshop Guide
Use the workshop presentation at Scale 18x `Finding-Stranger-Things-In-Code.pdf` as a guide to complete this workshop. The three modules are marked in the slides and contain all the commands presented in the workshop. You can directly copy/paste and run them on the Joern Shell.
